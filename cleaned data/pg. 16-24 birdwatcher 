Clear & cold
Entered settlement with John
Rogers in Ledger after posting a/c
& spent rest of day on Xmas tree
for children. Small tree in
nursery - Mama, Papa, Aunt Helen,
Collins, Flo, Lyneore, "Gussette", Leo & May
de Camp. Mr. & Miss de C. Annie
Miller & her father. Mr. Eaton, C. M. M.
& Charley, Fannie & Fred. John Rogers &
family, Rudolf Cress & fam. with our
4 servants enjoyed the pretty sight.
Nothing can compare with a xmas
tree.


Bitterly cold. Flo froze her cheeks
by driving to the Falls. Very much
interested again in people. Eyes are
such tell-tale things. Sad memories
of happy days called back by the
child joy of a glowing xmas tree;
deep hope in a heart beat nd
break in spite of its manliness
if the hope of the dear one's life
were not kept in spite of everything.
The devotion of which the human heart
is capable, the wonderful force
of determined will - the
mystery of the living man & woman.


Spent day starting mother's new Ledger - transferring her a/ct to a book
of her own. C.C. [[M?]] gave me much valuable help on double entry etc.


Worked a little more on a/c of father & mother - can't do anything more
with it except in verifying work done until father takes it up.


Verified a/c. Wrote Mrs. Edwards, Buffalo, this week about paymts &
sent our list to be supplemented by her.
Little Carolyn is angelic & demoniacal. An angel of winning affection and
intelligence one moment, and an imp of fine passion the next - her
temper [[underlined]] must [[/underlined]] be conquered now or it will
pervert her. She is a wonderfully loyal true hearted child. Control is what
she needs.


Flo home again and tired out. All family down sick with colds, result of
[[rain?]] - 30Â°


Copied map for correction of Buffalo
Ferry St taxes & sent Mr. Mann
Filed old papers. Stopped to see Aunt Helen at mail time & old her of my
N. Y. project. La Quay has not come to settle yet. Collins & Flo went to
Falls & took Lyman to stay until Sunday P.M. Collins home at night.
Much interested in bits of history gleaned from old business letters. The
hardness of circumstances that wreck poor human lives [[id?]] teach
divine charity.


Filing Grand Rapids and Council Grove papers to-day - finished. Mr
Mann of Buffalo writes about Ferry St. taxes and title. Little cannot be
cleared until $50 is paid on tax bought originally by Turner. Mrs.
Edwards acc't not sent, but my copy of paym'ts retd to me.
My Savings Bank credit sent me in ck to-night - $528.13 $240 of wh.
goes to Cheese Facty Stock - money advanced in Nov. by father


Went down to Uncle Charleys & fd him wi an organ.
We played & sang together & I left him wi a look in his eyes f / new life &
hope + w coming 2 him t made me wiser & sadder. / trajidy & / lives we
[[underlined]] over [[/underlined]]-look might well make / angels weep.
He is deeply moved by music & it will b a power 2 him now & influence
his childrens lives. / sadness & / human lot!


/ storm o yesterday over. Went down to Aunt Helens in the evening and
had a cosy visit. She is lonely but will not be sad. Her life is a lesson to
the demanding world. "Self dependence" is the key to her calm peaceful
old age. Matthew Arnold touched the soul of that spirit.


Worked on old papers all day. Papa went to Syracuse on law suit
(Williams). [[Mother?]] dressmaking for me & I trying to finish papers
before leaving.
Flo & Mr de C went to Boonville.


Papers again all day. Papa in Albany talking Warren Miller for senator.
The class letter rejoiced my heart.
Vive la '86!


Finished all that can be done till Papa returns - dead tired
with work at night- growing stupid with the monotony - won't be able to
write unless I get rested before I start.


Letter from [[Mama?]] to-day reporting a third parcel of land found by
Slade that must be bought to clear Ferry St. title. $25 more. Got my a/c
straight and ready for N.Y. to-day and odd work done.
Beautiful letter fr Jeannette Perry.
Stormed so hard her children didn't go to school except Lyman & mail
on snow [[show?]] for Post Leyden.


Afraid I wd x b able 2 get 2 Post. at all, b in spite o storm John took me 2
Mrs Mittlesey's where I spent 1 night. She is a wonderffully interesting,
stimulating woman full o ambition, Female spirit & life & md 2 / most
phlymatic o commonplace Ques.
Mrs. Lyon-personification o old school parental [[underlined]] word law
[[/underlined]] authority. Fr. Cousin cynical old maid with false front.


Took train at Falls & went down to New York. Nine plots in mind -
elaborated several outlines on way down. Met Papa at Albany wi
defeated politicians Miller & Morton seen ([[Hislock?]] elected) li flock o
dejected crows. Diff phases o disappointmt, interesting study. Uncle
Wallace & Harry met us. Spent eving in Alice's room - first introd to their
life] - Conway,. Putzel, & Rice [[(ie?]] First taste o [[cat-in-strange?]]

Country girl's first appearance. A gent. on either side-not
a word 2 say 2 dissipate / in lot [[underlined]] uninteresting [[verdant?]]

matrimonial dangers after he has left the field. Kindly uncle, less
[[fearful?]], [[?]] at / situation. Finally country girl flies from the enemy -
routed,


& takes refuge between uncle and father. New phase o life - 1/2 literary
1/2 small-talk. New strange [[?]] - [[please?]] - what [[underlined]] is
[[/underlined]] there to say? Silence tomblike! Broken by Mr. [[Rice?]]
who play [[divinely?]] on bass viol.


Satd. went to dinner given "Putz" for birthday.
Harry Mr. Smith Alice. Farquhar
Cous Putz
 F.A.M Rice Dr Putz Mrs. Smith


 It was 1st introd 2 Bohemianism. I w prepared 2 b shocked. I enjoyed it
immensely. We had one of [[Singhortmer's?]] best dinners - he excels
Delmonico. & Mrs. Smith & Alice sang half / time - piano in doorway.
Mrs. S sings divinely. All / party [[sobered?]] fr fun & rollicking merriment
by music. 1/2 lit. 1/2 musical party b most o [[enj?]] jolly good time -
boy's [[loss o freemans suit?]]. Mr. Rice won my


heart by agreeing that Patti has no soul in her music. He is a true
musician in spirit, He's a lawyer in bus. I sat stupidly silent /o I enjoyed it
all hugely. Had the pleasure o refusing wine all through / dinner. Gave it
up entirely last yr because
1st influence
2d " [[Ditto for: influence]]

4th - goes to my head.

Miss Ella came up from Lakewood & came to stay with me till Saturday.


Alice had a delightful evening, - Miss Ella & I spent it with her.
Dr. & Mrs. Cowan - Mr C is in the [[underline]] revising? bureau
[[/underline]] where all sorts of [[underline]] MSS [[/underline]] are
[[underline]] re-written [[/underline]]; Mr. [[Paris?]], one of the St. Nick
editors; Mr. an amateur musician. [[etc?]] were there. Mr. Cowan
advised me to practice [[underline]] versifying [[/underline]]. He says the
drill it gives -


being obliged, as you are, to compress yr vols into certain prescribed
limits - is most excellent
preparation for [[underlined]] prose [[/underlined]] work Common sense
& hard work are the 2 great essentials, he says. Success depends gtly
on consultation on the demand of the market.


Harry was away, & Alice, Miss Ella & I had a cozy evning to ourselves. I
was busy copying Ms. Ulich They served. Mr. & Mrs. Harland & Mr.
Brooks came in later. Mrs H is charming.
Satdy. Vassar Alumni Reception. Mrs. Badlens strong masculine face.
Old Mr. Vassar, Prof Rasclus etc. Fine class o women.


Last Saturday
Uncle Wallace took Papa, Edie, Miss Collins, & me to see Buffalo Bill.
As /ey say it is [[underline]] History, [[/underline]] & well worth seeing. It
is a sad comment on / tragic hist o / Indians & / cheifs should now be
going / world over exhibiting /emselves & /eir modes o life f / amusement
o / white man & expending /eir ferocity in sham battles, races ar'd /
[[underlined]] ring [[/underlined]] etc! If it meant /


conquest o civilization & nothing more / story o / sad red man wd b a
comedy.
Harry, Alice, & I went to Mrs. Harland's to dinner, to meet Mr. Sartain &
a friend of his from Phil. Henry & Mrs. S had a discussion on the
comparative artistic quality of Thackery & Howell. Mr. S had one of his


portraits that he loaned
Mrs. Harland - the head
of a colored girl - a remarkable
study - a drama in
a face - a whole novel.
Looked for Flo, but she
did not come.


Flo came down from home.
Uncle Wallace starting
for the west. Poor
Edith - and her poor
father. Her life is very
desolate, & will be more
so when she leaves.
It is a pitiful thing to see a
grayhaired man starting out to
begin life over again, after trying
one thing after another all his
life & never succeeding in
anything - disappted b & embittered
of a love & kindly [[underlined]] brotherhood. [[/underlined]]


Went to Wallack's with
Edith to see Sheridan's
School for Scandal. It is
sparkling with wit, & the
setting is capital - especially
Gilberts, but you feel that
the play belongs to the 16th
cent & needs expurgation. It
leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
Delightful ev'ng in Alice's room.
A musical - violin & piano
ev'ng - & full eving - seven in.
Mr Marlitus played till after 12.


We went to see Gaby's Taming
of the Shrew - Harry & Alice,
"Putz" & the Dr "Cole" & his sister.
We had a box - wretched place
to see. It is beautifully put on.
Old "Will" ought to have been
there. It would have done his
heart good. Every detail
of acting & scenic effect is
capital. We went to Baser's
afterwards & Dr. Putzel gave us a
supper - white bait, clams, etc.
