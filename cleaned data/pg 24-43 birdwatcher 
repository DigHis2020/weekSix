Mr. John Constable called Took lunch with Aunt Miriam & went to a
Symphony Concert at Chickering Hall afterwards. Greatly interested in
orchestra - new phases o life every day. Char. o class o musicians.

indiff spirit o men disappointed me. At night Flo & I went to hear
Lohengrin. It was my first experience of Wagner - I became entirely
converted


I never saw or heard anything that compared with it. Wagner must b
among musicians what Browning is among poets. His strength of
realism & idealism amount to such wonderful [[?]]. The [[underline]] [[?]]
[[/underline]] of Mr. W. music is pervading. You are carried along by it as
with the roll and swell of the ocean. It stirs you to the deepest depths of
your nature & carries you along with its exquisite melody to the heights


of aspiration toward which it is always yearning and throbbing. Saturday
Edith & I went to hear the Meistersingers; and in the evning I went with
Harry & Alice to Miss Booth's? reception.
Arthur Stedman took dinner with us & went to Miss B's He introduced

Domett, of the Mail & Express - Miss Ella's friend, pointed out the

short beard & straight nose - eyes like artist; the man who planned
Central Park - quite noted in his way; Mrs. Gilder, who has been very


handsome in his day; several of the magazine writers; Mr & Mrs. Frank
Stockton, etc. Frank Stockton is very interesting. He is a little man -
rather short & quite slender. His face is thin & he is very dark, with high
cheek bones. Large dark eyes that give the charm to his face that is
furrowed with lines of humor. His wife is large blonde phlegmatic b w a
quiet twinkle in her eye as if she enjoyed his face.

wanting.

Gusset holds long conversations with John through the register when he
is fixing the fire. One of her favorite questions in & her attempts to keep
up her end of the convers. is amusing. "How are all the folks down at the
falls" Once she added [[strikethrough]] You're [[/strikethrough]] "I'll give
you ten cents if you go and bring my Mama up.


When she has to be punished she always threatens to go away "I am
going away tomorrow. I aint going to stay here any more." If we tell her
she'd better go [[underlined]] to-day [[/underlined]], she says oh no, she
is going [[underlined]] to-morrow [[/underlined]] ! She is very fond of
watching the birds and squirrels that come to the barrels in front of the


dining room window for corn. She says "the little birds sing [[underlined]]
so [[/underlined]] sweetly."
The intelligence is as yet mainly connected with her remarkable verbal
memory & her association of ideas.


Gusset & I went to Aunt Helen's on the crust & Auntie told Gusset the
story of Jack & the Beanstalk.
She told me of col'd girls in Washington studying geometry, reading
Caesar, etc. & preparing themselves for Normal Schools & thus for
teachers. She says the col'd boys & girls have more ambition & pride
than the whites in Wash.


Gusset thought one of the birds was an English sparrow, and was eager
to have it killed; but when she discovered that it was 'a dear little Junco'
she was all tenderness and sympathy.
