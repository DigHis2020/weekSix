Took a long walk with Aunt Helen - she after flowers - I after birds. We
went through the old Estate woods- came back through the Alders. I
watched a musical thrush singing for a long time, & got new points about
the red wing.


Mama & I went to Syra to the funeral of Tillie
Peare Owen - one of the saddest things I ever knew. Only 23 yrs old - a
bride & mother - her baby was christened by her side as she lay in
beautiful motherhood & in her bridal garments.
Her husband is agonized by her death.


Came home to take care of Gusset etc.
Stopped at the Seminary in Utica & saw Miss
Griffith, Miss Peck, Miss Butts, Maud Philip, & Mrs Pick.


Spent mg. correcting proof of June no. of
"Hints to Audubon Workers."
Took it to Falls to mail in P.M. Papa, Maud &
I go to "Pines" Mrs. Lyons very feeble.


Aunt Helen up to tea & went for walk in woods. Watched a scarlet
tanager.


Flo sent for part of her
things.
Take Gusset into my room, & go through all sorts of maternal anxieties
at night - 1st experience with child. Keep air off her with umbrella. pin in
on both sides, etc.


Flo's room cleaned & house generally settled from winter's mixture of
two families' possessions.


Papa left at 6.30 for Bromis Hall.
Spent mg. hanging curtains & putting house in order.
Alone with children & servants at night, but with Balder & my mother
slept without concern.


Hetta came on noon train - Gusset & I to met her - Aunt Helen to dinner.
Spent day getting off ms.
Get up mornings during this migration from 4.15-5.30 a.m.


My hair is turning gray - life is getting more intense & each generation
becomes white earlier. If we only learned the [[underlined]] lessons
[[/underlined]] of gray hairs!


Mother back Sat'd night. Great relief after week of keeping house,
house-cleaning, looking after serving girl & gardener, [[underlined]] &
[[/underlined]] two children: getting up to [underlined]] observe
[[/underlined]] at early dawn, correcting proof, preparing ms. & trying to
entertain Hetta etc.


Beautiful mg. spent with Hetta - first real talk we have had. A true
woman's words put one on dry land again. What is the world without
[[underlined]] real [[/underlined]] conversation - where "clothes" are
discarded & / truth is spoken fr / soul.


Spend mg with Hetta in woods - P.M. drive to Port with [[underlined]]
eight [[/underlined]] boxes of lilies of the valley & wild flowers, to send
off.


Family - Mama - Hetta & Aunt Helen - spend day at Falls.


Dine at Aunt Helen's. One of her proverbial "rolly-poley's
Drive with Hetta & Gusset in P.M - another helpful talk. She is a noble
woman.
Papa returns from the woods.


Hetta leaves - take her to Port - Gusset - John - this A.M.


Dr. Johnson came to get Harts battery. I moved into the library and feel
as if I'd gotten where I belong - room to breathe and work.
