I used digital analysis techniques to research Florence Bailey, a pioneering ornithologist during the late 19th and early 20th century. 
Although the journal entries are not particularly telling of her specific interest in birdwatching, the analysis of her words still reveal details about her life. 
Further, I believe that the journal entries hold clues to what life as an upper class American woman in turn-of-the-century New York. 

I used two methods of analysis to discern patterns in the journal entries: Voyant and excel graph creation. 
Before I inputted data from her diary, I ran each paragraph through sublime text editor to clean the data and remove some of the irrelevant notes like "strikethrough" and "unknown" that the transcriber had added during the diary's time in the archive.
This resulted in three files of the cleaned data that can be viewed as text files in repo. 
I inputted the cleaned data into Voyant and there were several patterns that emerged that seemed important to me. 
1. She was part of an extensive social circle which included all varieties of family, friends, and acquaintances whom she interacted with often. 
2. She took an interest in the German language, encouraged by her friend Hetta. 
3. This social environment that Florence existed in supplemented and encouraged her passion for birdwatching and nature. 

The excel graph I created was drawn on by her January finances chart that was included at the back end of her diary. 
The graph detailed her expenditures throughout the month, broken down into categories of food, home management (which includes clothing her family, paying the cleaning lady, buying thread etc.), entertainment, car fees, and undetermined expenses. 
The two largest expenses for her were home-related and entertainment. 
Bailey spent almost all of her money buying clothes for her and her family.
She also attended a great deal of operas and art exhibits which an opportunity likely lent to her by her class privileges. 

This graph scrapes the surface of a woman's responsibilities in Bailey's society. From the graph and from the text analysis, it seems clear that Bailey organized her household and cared for several members of her family. 

My journey into applied digital history is similar to Moravec's, who analyzed someone of similar stature in their respective communities: a respected and groundbreaking professional in a male-dominated environment. We both made similar realizations during our process of analysis that digital history has a very circular pattern of events. Every discovery of a trend leads to more questions about the work, which in turn results in more analysis. 

For example, Moravec notices patterns in certain word usages (THE) and that led her down a path of analyzing what those choice of words meant to the overall themes that permeated Schneeman's entire body of work. 

From here, I think that the interesting path forward in research would be to use digital analysis tools to better understand her social networks and understand her perspective on the ornithological academic world in which she found herself a part of. There is an abundance of material to work with, as many names emerged in repetition. 
I think that I would also look into analyzing the correposndence between her and her students. I believe that this would reveal greater details about Bailey's habits of work and philosophy as it related to ornithology.
